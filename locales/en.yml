      Millwright's Restaurant and Tavern serves modern New England cuisine in a
      historic, seventeenth-century mill. Chef / Owner Tyler Anderson, a 2015
      James Beard nominee, crafts seasonally inspired dishes using produce and
      products from local farms and purveyours. Because of the seasonlity of
      the ingredients, new menus are created weekly, so guests will select their
      three course meal at the reception. If you have food allergy, please note
      it on the response card.
